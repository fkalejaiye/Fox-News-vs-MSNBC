# Proposals for Capstone 2

## Big Cats
>This project will focus on creating a model that can accurately predict the species of a big cat given a picture. All 7 species of big cats will be considered.

>My approach to this will be to get a large collection of images of different species from google via web scraping. I will then transform them into a format in which I can use them in python. I will then use various regression types to try and fit my data and come up with a model.

>Users will be able to interact with this via a flask app that I will create. The user will be able to submit a picture of a big cat and then receive a prediction of what type of big cat it is, along with some information about the particular species.

## House Prices
> This project will attempt to create a model that given a zip code, square footage, and other features, can accurately predict the selling price of a house in the Austin Texas area.

>My aproach will be to scrape the website realtor.com for homes within the austin texas area. I will compile a data set of each home with it's corresponding features and use this to fit a model. 

>Users will interact with this via a flask app that I will create in which a user can enter certain information and receive a predicted price.
