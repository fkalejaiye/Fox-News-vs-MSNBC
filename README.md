# Media Bias


## Background

>In American society today, trust in the media is significantly lower than it has been in previous years. Terms like fake news and media bias have beomce commonplace in our national discourse. There are entire news sources that seem more dedicated to disseminating their own take on the current state of affairs in our nation, rather than unbiasedly and factually reporting the news. Two such websites are Occupy Democrats, and Breitbart. Breitbart is an online news outlet with a strong conservative bias. Occupy Democrats is very similar, but they have a very strong liberal bias. Both websites often contain propaganda and report misleading info. These two websites are prefect candidates to use to understand media bias.

## Questions/Objectives

> The questions that I want to answer with this study are as follows:
1) Create a model that can accurately predict whether a news article is from Occupy Democrats or Breitbart.
2) Interpret the model and find what words and phrases are most common with each news source.
3) Used unsupervised learning to find the most important topic/themes for each news source and compare them.

## Tools

>1) Web Scraping : Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Python 3, Docker, MongoDB.

>2) Data Cleaning and Visualization: Python3, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

>3) Data analysis and Model Building: Python3, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, NLTK.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

>I scraped about 5673 movies from each website. My total dataset contained about 11,200 articles.

>The majority of articles had on average between 0 and 1000 words for both sources. However, Breitbart had a higher frequency of articles that were over 1000 words.
